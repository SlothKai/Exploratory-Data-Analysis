# Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts for exploratory data analysis on various datasets. It serves as a personal practice ground for honing data analysis skills and techniques.

## Key Features

- Data import and cleaning processes
- Data quality checks and issue identification
- Preliminary hypothesis generation
- Diverse datasets from various domains

## Overview

This repository is a personal project aimed at improving my skills in exploratory data analysis. Each notebook or script represents a practice session or a small project where I apply different data analysis techniques to various datasets. The goal is to enhance my ability to quickly understand, clean, and derive initial insights from data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas

## Projects

1. [Tax Rate Data Analysis](./Tax_Rate_Data_Analysis/)
   - Analysis of tax rate data for various countries, focusing on Indonesia
   - Identifies data quality issues and inconsistencies
2. [Countries and Cities Data Analysis](./Countries_And_Cities_Data_Analysis)
   - In progress

(Will be adding more projects here as I create them)

## Usage

To use the notebooks in this repository:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (listed in each notebook)
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the cells

## Learning Objectives

- Improve data cleaning and preprocessing skills
- Enhance ability to identify data quality issues
- Practice creating meaningful visualizations
- Develop intuition for initial data exploration
- Hone critical thinking and problem-solving skills

## Note

This is a personal learning repository. The analyses here may not be comprehensive or production-ready, but rather reflect my learning journey in data analysis.
